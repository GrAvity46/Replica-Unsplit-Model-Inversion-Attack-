# Model Inversion and Part Classification

## Introduction

This repository contains Jupyter notebook scripts for performing model inversion attacks and part classification using PyTorch. The notebooks are organized based on different split layer settings for the part classifier model.

### Model Inversion

Model inversion is a type of attack where an adversary attempts to reconstruct sensitive input data based on the output of a machine learning model. In this project, we explore model inversion attacks in the context of a part classifier model trained on casting images.

## Notebooks

The repository includes the following notebooks:

- **Model_Inversion_split_layer_2.ipynb**: Notebook implementing the part classifier model with a split layer setting of 2.
- **Model_Inversion_split_layer_3.ipynb**: Notebook implementing the part classifier model with a split layer setting of 3.
- **Model_Inversion_split_layer_4.ipynb**: Notebook implementing the part classifier model with a split layer setting of 4.
- **Model_Inversion_split_layer_6.ipynb**: Notebook implementing the part classifier model with a split layer setting of 6.
- **Model_Inversion_split_layer_8.ipynb**: Notebook implementing the part classifier model with a split layer setting of 8.

Each notebook explores the impact of different split layer settings on model performance and vulnerability to model inversion attacks.

## Dependencies

The scripts require the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- torchvision
- torchsummary
- PIL

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib torchvision torchsummary Pillow
